    "The overall process for cleaning our data was simple, but there were a few unexpected issues that took significantly more time to solve. We didn't want to torture our data, so we first followed typical clean up procedures and simple line plots for time series. Unexpected issues arose wwhen trying to plot two separate time series together, when different types or lengths were used within the same data frame, or when different types were nested within each other.\n",

    "Most of the data sets were messy and many had more information than needed or not enough information, so we dropped blank or unnecessary rows before plotting in order to see the true meaning of the data. Occasionally, dropping was required due to the wrong type of data in place of no data recorded for certain demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when observing the increased participation rate of women in the workforce grouped by race, we couldn't plot properly because some of the rows had string placeholders ('-') instead of NA or the integer 0. We had to make separate data frames for each race and then drop the rows that were distorting the plot. Then we were able to plot all together.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our API calls could only be made 10 at a time. We put these calls into six different data frames only to realize that the data frames were extremely nested. Upon looking at the types and lengths, we were able to create loops to go through the requests and append certain information to lists that could be placed into a new data frame. There was not much help on the internet about this issue, so it took some time to realize the lists and dictionaries were densely nested. Thinking through how we would extract the pertinent information manually helped us to decide on using loops to append the data appropriately.\n",
